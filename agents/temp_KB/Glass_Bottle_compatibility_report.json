  "barrier_properties": {
    "score": 9,
    "explanation": "Glass offers excellent barrier properties against gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide), moisture, and aromas. This helps to maintain product freshness and prevent spoilage or changes in flavor/aroma. The inert nature of glass prevents interaction with the contents, further enhancing its barrier effectiveness.",
    "concerns": "The barrier is compromised if the glass is cracked or broken. Certain closures may not provide as effective a barrier as the glass itself."
  },
  "strength_durability": {
    "score": 7,
    "explanation": "Glass bottles are relatively strong and durable, capable of withstanding normal handling and transportation. They are resistant to crushing and deformation under moderate pressure. The thickness of the glass affects its overall strength.",
    "concerns": "Glass is brittle and susceptible to shattering upon impact or sudden temperature changes. Dropping a glass bottle can easily lead to breakage. Thin-walled bottles are more fragile."
  },
  "temperature_resistance": {
    "score": 6,
    "explanation": "Glass can withstand a wide range of temperatures, making it suitable for both hot-filled and cold-filled products. It is also microwave-safe and can be used for pasteurization or sterilization processes.",
    "concerns": "Sudden temperature changes (thermal shock) can cause glass to crack or shatter. Extreme temperature fluctuations should be avoided. Freezing liquids in glass bottles can also lead to breakage as the liquid expands."
  },
  "shelf_life_impact": {
    "score": 9,
    "explanation": "Due to its excellent barrier properties and inert nature, glass packaging can significantly extend the shelf life of many products, especially those sensitive to oxygen or moisture. It prevents degradation, spoilage, and loss of flavor or aroma, contributing to longer product viability.",
    "concerns": "While glass itself doesn't degrade, the product inside may still degrade over time due to other factors, even with the protection of the glass. Closure integrity is crucial for maximizing shelf life."
  },
  "chemical_compatibility": {
    "score": 10,
    "explanation": "Glass is highly chemically inert and compatible with a wide range of substances, including acidic, alkaline, and organic solvents. It does not react with or leach chemicals into the contents, ensuring product purity and safety. This makes it suitable for food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.",
    "concerns": "Certain highly corrosive chemicals (e.g., hydrofluoric acid) can etch or dissolve glass, but these are rarely used in typical consumer products. The closure material must also be chemically compatible with the contents."
