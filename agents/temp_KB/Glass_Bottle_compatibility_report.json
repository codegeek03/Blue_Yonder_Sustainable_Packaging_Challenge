  "barrier_properties": {
    "score": 9,
    "explanation": "Glass provides an excellent barrier against oxygen, moisture, and other gases. This prevents spoilage, flavor loss, and degradation of the contents. It is virtually impermeable, ensuring long-term protection.",
    "concerns": "Susceptible to breakage which can compromise the barrier."
  },
  "strength_durability": {
    "score": 7,
    "explanation": "Glass is rigid and strong under compression. The durability depends on the thickness and type of glass (e.g., borosilicate glass is more durable than soda-lime glass). Proper handling is required to avoid breakage from impact or thermal shock.",
    "concerns": "Fragile and prone to shattering upon impact. Can be heavy, adding to shipping costs and handling difficulties."
  },
  "temperature_resistance": {
    "score": 6,
    "explanation": "Glass can withstand a wide range of temperatures, but is susceptible to thermal shock. Rapid temperature changes can cause cracking or shattering. Borosilicate glass offers better temperature resistance than standard glass.",
    "concerns": "Susceptible to thermal shock; rapid temperature changes can lead to breakage. Certain types of glass have lower heat resistance."
  },
  "shelf_life_impact": {
    "score": 9,
    "explanation": "Due to its excellent barrier properties, glass helps extend the shelf life of food and beverage products. It prevents oxidation, moisture absorption, and microbial growth, preserving the product's quality and freshness for longer periods.",
    "concerns": "None, provided the closure system (lid, cap) also provides an adequate seal."
  },
  "chemical_compatibility": {
    "score": 8,
    "explanation": "Glass is generally inert and chemically compatible with a wide range of substances, including acidic and alkaline solutions. Some highly corrosive materials (e.g., hydrofluoric acid) can etch glass, but this is not a common concern for most applications.",
    "concerns": "Potential for leaching of trace elements from the glass into the contents under extreme conditions (high temperature, prolonged exposure to certain chemicals). Avoid use with hydrofluoric acid."
